# Computer Architecture & Low-Level Programming

This repository documents my journey through the fundamentals of computer architecture. It contains all lab assignments and projects from my course, where I explore the bridge between high-level code and the hardware that executes it. The primary languages used are **C** and **ARMv8 (AArch64) Assembly**.

## Core Concepts Explored

This course and its projects focus on key computer architecture topics, including:

*   **Data Representation:** Integer and floating-point number representation.
*   **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Understanding the ARMv8 instruction set.
*   **C Programming & Memory Management:** Pointers, memory allocation (`malloc`/`free`), and the process memory layout (stack, heap).
*   **Assembly Language:** Translating C constructs into ARMv8 assembly and writing assembly from scratch.
*   **CPU Logic & Pipelining:** How a processor fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.
*   **Memory Hierarchy:** The role of caches (L1/L2), main memory, and virtual memory.

## Projects & Labs Overview

Below is the collection of completed labs. As the course progresses, this table will be updated with new assignments.

| **Lab 01** | A performance analysis comparing a computationally intensive C program to its Python equivalent. The program uses nested loops to calculate cumulative sums, and the goal was to measure and contrast instruction count, clock cycles, and execution time. | C Programming, Performance Analysis, Compiled vs. Interpreted  | [`./lab1`](./lab1)        |
